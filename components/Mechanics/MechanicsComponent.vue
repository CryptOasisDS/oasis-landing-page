            The OG Senate will initially consist of 16 trusted members of Oasis. They will review the overall
            pool of proposed projects. Only projects voted for by the majority of OGs can pass on. The OGs get a % of the project's fees for their efforts (in case of successful fundraising).

            One of the Tribunes may use the veto and send the project back for a second vote. The Tribunes also receive a % of the fees. Unlike the Senate, there are only 2 and they are elected for 6 months. One of the Oasis developers can also be nominated for one of the seats, the second seat will always be for an independent OG candidate.

            If the project was approved by the OG and was not blocked by the Tribunals, it goes to the next final stage. It will be presented to investors.

            Investors receive a % of the project's income for their investment. The author of the project himself assigns the %, which will be available for sale to potential investors.
